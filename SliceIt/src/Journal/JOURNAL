05/04/17- My goal was to figure out what exactly I am going to do for my project and how many
		  functions my game- slice it, is going to have. Also I am going to try to link up with 
		  github correctly.I accomplished all of these things today and tomorrow I am going to be
		  working on the background of the game.
		  
05/05/17- I am going to be working on the background today. Fixed a lot of gui issues.

05/08/17- Had a gui problem where it would not run my code. Mr. Nockles fixed it for me and it works now. Also
		  computer kept crashing and also had network problems alongside with that. These were major obstacles for me to work
		  today. 
		  Today, I made improvements to my screen. I made a button and few texts. I will be working on the actual game screen 
		  tomorrow.
		  
05/09/17- I added instructions of the game and I made a button that takes you from the menu screen to the game screen. 
		  I didn't really finish because the button doesn't really work.
