05/04/17- My goal was to figure out what exactly I am going to do for my project and how many
		  functions my game- slice it, is going to have. Also I am going to try to link up with 
		  github correctly.I accomplished all of these things today and tomorrow I am going to be
		  working on the background of the game.
		  
05/05/17- I am going to be working on the background today. Fixed a lot of gui issues.

05/08/17- Had a gui problem where it would not run my code. Mr. Nockles fixed it for me and it works now. Also
		  computer kept crashing and also had network problems alongside with that. These were major obstacles for me to work
		  today. 
		  Today, I made improvements to my screen. I made a button and few texts. I will be working on the actual game screen 
		  tomorrow.
		  
05/09/17- I added instructions of the game and I made a button that takes you from the menu screen to the game screen. 
		  I didn't really finish because the button doesn't really work.
		  
05/10/17- Absent.
05/11/17- Still working on my GameScreen. Encountered a lot of compilation errors. Was not able to fix it. Also Github errors.
			Was not able to push.
			
05/12/17- Worked on my game screen. got the next button to work which changes screen. Was not able to push.
05/15/17- Was not able to push for the last two classes but with the help of mr. nockles today, it was fixed today.
		  It also took away half the work time of the period.
05/16/17- Came in late today but I was able to display random fruits in my screen.
05/22/17- Very productive day. Mr. nockles helped me with my gamescreen class which 
		  helps me organize my code. Also i got fruits to display randomly and then switch
		  after a certain amount of time.
05/23/17- Today I downloaded ALL of my images which surprisingly took the entire period.
05/24/17- Got a lot of work done today. Coded how to respawn images and the text in random places.
		  Implemented all the images also.
05/25/17- Absent.
05/26/17- Got a worked a lot today. I made a timer. And also made couple of methods for the fruits and the fruit display.
		  Still need help to get multiple images to appear at once.
05/30/17- Added another component to my game- the bombs. couldn't get the timing right still. Asked a lot of my peers but they did not know either.
05/31/17- With the help of Mr. Nockles I was able to fix the timing issue. Didn't have time to work on other stuff. 
06/01/17- Absent.
06/02/17- I'm finally working on updating the score when the image is clicked. Made slight progress on that. Still getting runtime errors. 
06/05/17- Had a lot of issues with putting up the background. When I put the background in it breaks the code.
06/06/17- The background issue is still not solved but luckily today I have completed 80% of the project and I just have to brush it up a bit 
		  and put some finishing touches.
