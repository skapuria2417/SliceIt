05/04/17- My goal was to figure out what exactly I am going to do for my project and how many
		  functions my game- slice it, is going to have. Also I am going to try to link up with 
		  github correctly.I accomplished all of these things today and tomorrow I am going to be
		  working on the background of the game.
